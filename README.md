<h5> Features </h5>

<li>Authentication</li>
<p>only logged user can view all the campgrounds but cannot add new campgrounds. To add new campground user have to logged in first and than addd new campgrounds<br>
Campground Schema includes Title, Location, Price, Images and description. I have added both the client side and server side validations. for client-side validation, i have used bootstrap class (class="validated-form" and its related script) and for backend validation i have used JOI package where I predefined the JOI schema and compare that JOI schema with my campground Schema. I have also add the review features in every campground where user can add reviews and star rating and Only the logged user can add the reviews.

<p>Only the authorized User can delete and edit their existed campgrounds. Also Authorized User can delete their created reviews (Owner of the campground is referred as authorized User of that campground) </p>
